# Basic Quiz Game 

## Project Overview

The Basic Quiz Game is a simple interactive quiz application built in Python. The game asks users a series of questions and evaluates their performance based on their answers. This project aims to reinforce Python fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, and user input handling, while providing practical experience in structuring a small Python project.

## Objectives

1. Build a simple quiz game that asks users a series of questions.
2. Implement a scoring system to evaluate the user's performance.
3. Enhance user interaction by allowing them to input their answers.
4. Reinforce Python fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, and user input handling.
5. Gain practical experience in structuring a small Python project.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions:** The game presents a series of questions with multiple answer options.
- **User Input Handling:** Users input their answers by entering the corresponding option number.
- **Score Calculation:** The game keeps track of the score and provides feedback on each answer.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that user inputs are valid and handles exceptions gracefully.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into functions to enhance readability and maintainability:

1. **ask_question(question, options, correct_answer):** 
   - This function displays a question and its options, collects user input, and checks if the answer is correct.
   
2. **main():**
   - The main function runs the quiz game, initializes questions, tracks the score, and displays the final score at the end of the game.

## How to Run the Code

1. Copy the code into a Python environment (e.g., Python IDE or an online compiler).
2. Run the program to start the quiz game.
3. Follow the prompts to answer the questions.
